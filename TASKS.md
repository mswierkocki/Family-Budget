# Task: Family Budget App

1. Description
The application should allow for creating several users. Each user can create a list of
any number of budgets and share it with any number of users. The budget consists of
income and expenses. They are grouped into categories. It is required to create REST or
GraphQL API and a database. The project should contain authorisation, tests, fixtures,
filtering and pagination.

2. Technologies
Any. Whatever would be best in your opinion (including JS frameworks).

3. Requirements
Entire project should be available as an open source project on GitHub. Please
commit your work on a regular basis (rather than one huge commit). The project should
contain a README file with information how to install the application in a local environment.

4. Deploy
Please use Docker for orchestration (docker-compose).

In case of any questions, use your best judgement.
